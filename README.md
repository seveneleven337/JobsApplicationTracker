# JobsApplicationTracker

We want to create a project that addresses the challenges of managing a high volume of job applications. The goal is to help users keep track of important details for each application, such as job descriptions, expected salary, and other relevant information. This would allow users to easily search by criteria like company name and view all related applications along with their associated details.
